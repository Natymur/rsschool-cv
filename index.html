    <section class="about-me">
      <p>I’m working as a software testing engineer more than 2 years. I had many different and interesting projects in medicine, in tourism, in advertising. As for now I'm working on the project based on Salesforce </p>

      <p>My work includes analyzing requirements and preparing testing documentation. During the project, I perform functional testing of the product using different types of testing. Reporting defects perform with the help of Jira defect tracking system. I re-test and close the defects providing the evidence that the defect had been fixed. During the whole project, I communicate with the team on emerging issues. At the end of the project, I prepare a test result report for the customer.</p>

      <p>During the work on the project, I often can propose new ideas on the team meetings on how we can make new features more usability and more useful for users because I’m always on the side of the user and I thinking about how users want to see our application and if the application coverы all user needs.</p>
      <p>Also, I help developers to understand the project much better and I always explain incomprehensible moments.</p>

      <p>I'm always glad to learn something new, I am highly motivated, colleagues mark me as a good team player.</p>
